    "### **1. Dataset Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project focuses on Pokémon statistics and attributes. It contains **801 entries** and **41 columns**. Each row represents a Pokémon, including its base stats, type classifications, and other descriptive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Features**\n",
    "- **Categorical Attributes**:\n",
    "  - `type1`, `type2`: The primary and secondary elemental types of each Pokémon.\n",
    "  - `is_legendary`: Indicates whether a Pokémon is legendary (1 for yes, 0 for no).\n",
    "- **Numerical Attributes**:\n",
    "  - Base stats such as `attack`, `defense`, `hp`, `speed`, etc.\n",
    "  - Derived stats like `base_total`, which is the sum of all base stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was selected for its diversity in both categorical and numerical features, making it suitable for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Data Cleaning**\n",
    "The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and inconsistencies:\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "  - Categorical columns (`type2`) were filled with \"None\" for Pokémon without a secondary type.\n",
    "  - Numerical columns (`height_m`, `weight_kg`, `percentage_male`) were imputed using median or mean values.\n",
    "- **Feature Conversion**:\n",
    "  - `capture_rate` was converted to numeric, handling any non-numeric values.\n",
    "- **Final Check**:\n",
    "  - Removed duplicates and ensured consistency in all columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "EDA was performed to understand the dataset and guide feature selection. Key insights include:\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Strong positive correlations were observed among `base_total`, `attack`, `defense`, and `sp_attack`. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Base total stats follow a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 300-400 and 500-600. \n",

    "##### **Performance**\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: 95.65%\n",
    "- **Confusion Matrix**:\n",
    "  - Non-legendary Pokémon predictions were highly accurate.\n",
    "  - Legendary Pokémon predictions suffered due to class imbalance. \n",
